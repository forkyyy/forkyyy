### Legacy Security Research & Applied Network Engineering

This account serves as a **historical archive of my earlier technical work** under the alias **“forky”** —  
a period focused on low-level networking, distributed systems, and packet-level experimentation.

Over time, these materials are being **sanitized, restructured, and re-contextualized** to emphasize  
their educational and defensive relevance. Tools and analyses originally created for exploration  
are now being updated to support **mitigation, detection, and academic research** into large-scale  
network behavior and security phenomena. And more from this time as this aliasd will also be posted on the future, with the same idea.

## 🌐 Mission

Preserve and document the technical evolution of the *forky* era, transforming past tooling into  
a transparent, responsible knowledge base for:

- **DDoS mitigation and reflection-attack analysis**  
- **Honeypot & telemetry engineering**  
- **Protocol behavior research (UDP, TCP, HTTP/2, etc.)**  
- **Network forensics, packet processing, and automation**

Everything here is published in accordance with **responsible disclosure principles**  
and focuses on **educational, defensive, and research-approved usage** only.

## 🧩 Transition to Deep Research

The ongoing research and academic work are now published under  
**[Kaike Southier](https://github.com/kaikesouthier)** — focusing exclusively on:

- Advanced network modeling and simulation  
- Global traffic telemetry and distributed observability  
- Ethical security research and real-world mitigation architectures  

The separation between **forkyyy** and **Kaike Southier** ensures clarity between  
historical engineering experiments and contemporary, peer-reviewed research.

## ⚙️ Current Work (2025 → 2026)

- Gradually refactoring legacy repositories into clean, educational artifacts  
- Adding in-depth write-ups describing mitigation strategies for previously exploited vectors  
- Contributing to open datasets and tools that support defensive research  
- Maintaining transparency about the technical journey from experimentation → professional research
